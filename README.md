# driverdiskinstall
A simple utility to help with installing XenServer ISO-based drivers

This is a basic utility.  It expects that you download it and copy it to /usr/sbin OR /usr/bin and ensure the permissions are made "executable".

This can be done by executing 'chmod +x /usr/sbin/driverdiskinstall' or, if you copied it to /usr/bin/ then 'chmod +x /usr/bin/driverdiskinstall'

# How to use it
After copying a XenServer driver ISO to the XenServer host, you must execute 'driverdiskinstall nameof.iso' or 'driverdiskinstall /path/to/nameof.iso'

The rest is pretty straight forward!
